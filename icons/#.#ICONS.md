Go to favicon.io and generate a favicon for the project. Use any image you want.

Extract the zip folder, and copy the `android-chrome-512x512.png` to be renamed `icon.png` in the `icons` folder.

You're not done yet; copy the file again and bring it to the `renderer/static` folder to be renamed `favicon.png`.
