# `renderer/static/` - Unprocessed Assets

This directory is the home for any file that should be included in your application **without any processing**. Files here are served directly by the development server and copied as-is into the final build output.

## Purpose

The `static` folder is for assets that are not directly imported into your Svelte components. This includes global stylesheets, fonts, images referenced in CSS, and other files that need a stable, predictable URL.

## Current Structure

```
static/
├── fonts/
│   └── aattackgraffiti/
│       └── placeholder.txt
├── styles/
│   └── main.css
└── favicon.png
```

## How to Use Assets

-   **Referencing in HTML**: In your `app.html` or a component's `<svelte:head>`, refer to these files with a root-relative path.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/main.css" />
    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.png" />
    ```

-   **Referencing in CSS**: In a CSS file (like `main.css`), you can reference other static assets, like fonts, using relative paths.

    ```css
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'MyCoolFont';
      src: url('/fonts/aattackgraffiti/coolfont.woff2') format('woff2');
    }
    ```

## Static vs. `lib/` Assets

-   **Use `static/` for:** Global assets that are not tied to a specific component. Fonts, favicons, global stylesheets, and manifest files belong here.
-   **Import assets into `lib/` for:** Component-specific assets. If an image is part of a specific component (like an avatar), it's often better to place it in `lib/assets/` and import it directly into your `.svelte` file. This allows Vite to hash the filename for optimal caching.

## Best Practices for Excellence

1.  **Optimize Before Adding**: Compress images, convert fonts to the modern `WOFF2` format, and minify CSS and JS files before placing them here. The `static` directory does not do this for you.
2.  **Keep it Organized**: Maintain a clear folder structure (`fonts/`, `images/`, `styles/`) to keep the directory easy to navigate.
3.  **Use Absolute Paths**: When referencing static assets from your code, always use root-relative absolute paths (starting with a `/`). This prevents broken links as your routing structure changes.
