# `renderer/routes/` - Application Pages & Layouts

This directory is the foundation of your application's structure and navigation, powered by SvelteKit's elegant **file-based routing**. The layout of folders and files here directly maps to the "pages" a user can see.

## Core Concepts

-   **Pages (`+page.svelte`)**: Each file named `+page.svelte` creates a new page in your app. The path to the file becomes the page's route (e.g., `routes/game/+page.svelte` becomes the `/game` page).

-   **Layouts (`+layout.svelte`)**: A layout is a special component that wraps page components. It's used to create shared UI elements (like headers, sidebars, or global effects) that persist across multiple pages. The layout in the root of this directory applies to *every single page*.

## Current Route Structure

```
routes/
├── +layout.svelte    # The Root Layout (wraps everything)
├── +page.svelte      # The Home Page (route: /)
└── game/
    └── +page.svelte  # The Game Page (route: /game)
```

## How to Navigate

Navigation between pages is handled programmatically, which is ideal for a desktop application.

-   **The `goto` function**: SvelteKit provides a powerful `goto` function for moving between pages.

    ```svelte
    <script lang="ts">
        import { goto } from '$app/navigation';

        async function goToGame() {
            // Navigate to the /game route
            await goto('/game');
        }
    </script>

    <button on:click={goToGame}>Start</button>
    ```

## Best Practices for Excellence

1.  **Group by Feature**: Organize your routes into folders that represent features of your application (e.g., `routes/settings/`, `routes/profile/`, `routes/dashboard/`).

2.  **Use Layouts for Shared UI**: If multiple pages within a feature (like `/settings/account` and `/settings/notifications`) share the same sidebar, create a `routes/settings/+layout.svelte` to hold that shared code.

3.  **Data Loading (`+page.ts`)**: For pages that need to load data from the Rust backend before they are displayed, create a sibling file named `+page.ts`. This file can export a `load` function that fetches data, which then becomes automatically available to your `+page.svelte` component.

4.  **Keep Pages Focused**: A page component's main job is to arrange other, smaller components. Avoid putting huge amounts of logic directly into a `+page.svelte` file. Break down complex UIs into reusable components that live in `renderer/lib/`.
