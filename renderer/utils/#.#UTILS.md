# `renderer/utils/` - Frontend Utilities

This directory is a designated place for general-purpose utility functions that are used across your SvelteKit frontend.

## Purpose

While `renderer/lib/` is intended for Svelte-specific constructs (components, actions, stores), `utils/` is perfect for pure, framework-agnostic helper functions. This separation keeps your codebase clean and organized.

## Examples of Good Utilities

-   **Data Formatting**: Functions that format dates, numbers, or strings in a consistent way (e.g., `formatDate(isoString)`, `formatCurrency(cents)`).
-   **Validation Logic**: Pure functions that validate user input, like checking if an email is valid or a password meets complexity requirements (e.g., `isValidEmail(email)`).
-   **Complex Calculations**: Helper functions that perform pure mathematical or algorithmic transformations on data.
-   **DOM Helpers**: Functions that perform common DOM manipulations or measurements.

## Best Practices for Excellence

1.  **Keep Functions Pure**: A good utility function is "pure." This means that for a given input, it always returns the same output, and it has no side effects (i.e., it doesn't modify anything outside of itself). This makes them incredibly easy to test and reason about.

2.  **No Svelte Dependencies**: Utility functions in this directory should not import anything from Svelte or SvelteKit. If a function needs Svelte-specific features, it belongs in `renderer/lib/` as an action or a helper.

3.  **Group by Domain**: As your collection of utilities grows, organize them into separate files based on their purpose (e.g., `dateUtils.ts`, `stringUtils.ts`, `validation.ts`).

4.  **Write Unit Tests**: Because they are pure and have clear inputs and outputs, utility functions are the easiest part of your application to unit test. This is a great place to ensure your core logic is robust and bug-free.
