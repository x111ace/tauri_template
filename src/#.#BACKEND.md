# `src/` - The Rust Backend

This directory is the heart of your native application, powered by the Rust programming language and the Tauri framework. All high-performance, system-level, and secure logic lives here.

## Core Components

-   **`main.rs`**: The entry point of your Tauri application. This is where the application window is configured and launched.

-   **`Cargo.toml`**: The manifest file for the Rust package manager, Cargo. All your Rust dependencies (called "crates") are defined here.

## The Bridge to the Frontend

The frontend (in `renderer/`) and the backend communicate through a secure bridge. The primary mechanisms are:

-   **Tauri Commands (`#[tauri::command]`)**: These are special Rust functions that you can "invoke" directly from your SvelteKit frontend. Use them for actions that the frontend needs the backend to perform, such as file operations, database queries, or heavy computations.

-   **Tauri Events**: The backend can emit events that the frontend can listen for. This is perfect for notifying the UI of progress, background task completion, or state changes initiated by the system.

## Best Practices for Excellence

1.  **Keep `main.rs` Lean**: Your `main.rs` should only be for bootstrapping the application. Move all significant business logic into separate Rust modules (e.g., `src/database.rs`, `src/core_logic.rs`).

2.  **Commands are for Actions**: Design your commands to be clear, single-purpose actions (e.g., `get_user_data`, `save_file`).

3.  **Use Strong Types**: Define clear `struct`s for the data you pass between Rust and Svelte. This ensures type safety from end-to-end. Consider placing these types in the `shared/` directory if they need to be accessed by both sides.

4.  **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Your Rust functions should return `Result<T, E>` to handle potential errors. Tauri will automatically translate these into JavaScript Promises that either resolve or reject, allowing for clean error handling in the frontend.
